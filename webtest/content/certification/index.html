		The ISO 14001 is a family of standards related to environmental
		management that exists to help organizations
		<p>(a) minimize how their operations (processes, etc.) negatively affect the environment (i.e., cause adverse changes to air, water, or land);</p>
		<p>(b) comply with applicable laws, regulations, and other environmentally oriented requirements</p>
		<p>(c) continually improve in the above. ISO 14001 is similar to ISO 9001
			quality management in that both pertain to the process of how a
			product is produced, rather than to the product itself. As with ISO 9001,
			certification is performed by third-party organizations rather than
			being awarded by ISO directly.</p>
